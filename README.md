# 🔍 Searching 

## ✅ Linear Search (int array)
- Searches for a number in an integer array using linear search.

## ✅ Linear Search (String array)
- Searches for a word in a string array.

### 📌 Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm used on sorted arrays.
It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space becomes empty.

⚡ Types Implemented
Normal Binary Search – Works when the array is sorted in ascending order.

Order-Agnostic Binary Search – Works for both ascending and descending sorted arrays.

⏳ Time Complexity
Best Case: O(1)

Worst Case: O(log n)

File	Description
📂 Files:
`LinearSearch.java` :  Standard binary search on ascending sorted array
`LinearSearchString.java` : Binary search that works for both order types
