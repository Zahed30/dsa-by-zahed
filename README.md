# 🔍 Searching  

### ✅ Linear Search  
- **LinearSearch.java** → Searches for a number in an integer array.  
- **LinearSearchString.java** → Searches for a word in a string array.  

🧠 **Time Complexity**: O(n)  

---

# 📌 Binary Search  

Binary Search is a highly efficient searching algorithm used on **sorted arrays**.  
It works by repeatedly **dividing the search range in half** until the target is found or the range becomes empty.

## ⚡ Types Implemented  

1. **Normal Binary Search** – Works on ascending sorted arrays.  
2. **Order-Agnostic Binary Search** – Works for both ascending and descending arrays.  
3. **Binary Search Variations**:
   - `Ceiling.java` → Find the smallest element greater than or equal to the target.  
   - `floor.java` → Find the largest element smaller than or equal to the target.  
   - `FirstAndLastPosition.java` → Find the first and last occurrence of a target in a sorted array.  
   - `CountRotation.java` → Find how many times a sorted array is rotated.  
   - `Rotated.java` → Search in a rotated sorted array.  
   - `Smallest.java` → Find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.  
   - `Mountain.java` → Peak index in a mountain array.  
   - `SplitArray.java` → Split array to minimize largest sum.  
   - `RowColMatrix.java` → Search in a sorted 2D matrix (row-column sorted).  
   - `SortedMatrix.java` → Binary search on a fully sorted 2D matrix.

## ⏳ Time Complexity  

| Case       | Complexity |
|------------|------------|
| **Best**   | O(1)       |
| **Worst**  | O(log n)   |
---

💡 **Tip:** Binary Search only works on **sorted** arrays.  
If the array is not sorted, sort it first or use a different algorithm like Linear Search.

# 📁 04.Sorting

### 🔸 Topics Covered:

- Bubble Sort (basic idea & swapping adjacent elements)  
- Selection Sort (finding min element and placing at correct position)  
- Insertion Sort (building a sorted portion step by step)

### ⏱️ Time Complexities:

| Algorithm      | Best Case   | Average Case | Worst Case   | Space Complexity |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)        | O(n²)        | O(n²)        | O(1)             |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)        | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)        | O(n²)        | O(n²)        | O(1)             |
