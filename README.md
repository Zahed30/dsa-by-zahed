## 📅 Progress Tracker

| Day | Topic             | Status  |
|-----|-------------------|---------|
| 1   | Linear Search     | ✅ Done |
| 2   | Binary Search     | ✅ Done |
| 3   | Sorting (Bubble)  | ⏳ Planned |

# 🔍 Searching 

## ✅ Linear Search (int array)
- Searches for a number in an integer array using linear search.

## ✅ Linear Search (String array)
- Searches for a word in a string array.

🧠 Time Complexity: O(n)  
📂 Files: `LinearSearch.java`, `LinearSearchString.java`

# 📌 Binary Search  

Binary Search is a highly efficient searching algorithm used on **sorted arrays**.  
It works by repeatedly **dividing the search range in half** until the target is found or the range becomes empty.

---

## ⚡ Types Implemented  

1. **Normal Binary Search** – Works when the array is sorted in ascending order.  
2. **Order-Agnostic Binary Search** – Works for both ascending and descending sorted arrays.  

---

## ⏳ Time Complexity  

| Case       | Complexity |
|------------|------------|
| **Best**   | O(1)       |
| **Worst**  | O(log n)   |

---

## 📂 Files  

- **BinarySearch.java** → Standard binary search on ascending sorted array.  
- **OrderAgnosticBinarySearch.java** → Works for both ascending and descending arrays.  

---

💡 **Tip:** Binary Search only works on **sorted** arrays.  
If the array is not sorted, sort it first or use a different algorithm like Linear Search.
